# MNIST-CNN-Classifier
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset

# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a type of artificial neural network that is used in image recognition and processing that is specifically designed to process pixel data.
The CNN model is composed of:
Convolutional Layers (Conv2D) 
MaxPooling Layers (MaxPooling2D) 
Flatten Layer
Fully Connected Layers (Dense) 

# MNIST Dataset
The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten numbers taken as images. All images are grey scale.
It has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples.
Each image is 28x28 pixels.

# Model
The model was trained for 50 epochs and achieved a test accuracy of 98.93% with a test loss of 0.0988.
